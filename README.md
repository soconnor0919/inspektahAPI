2. Sprint 2: 11/9 - 11/16

--> aim to have a console-driven program finished by the end of Sprint 2 11/16. (extension agreed on by team due to complexities of statistical data constantly changing and the overall vastness of Amazon)

### Future note to team

--> Once API calling experience has been gained, as well as with additional APIs, we can look further into 'product price trackers' and possibly call their APIs, which may simplify a step or two in the GUI design/output process. 

----> examples of product price trackers : Keepa, Camelcamelcamel, PriceSpy, Pricepin, PriceGrabber, etc.
